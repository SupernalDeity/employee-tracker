## Description
I created a program that allows the user to create a database to store employee information while being able to make changes to it as need be. The user can add to, delete from and update the database.   

## Instructions
Install requirer@8.2.4, mysql2, and console.table by running npm install in the terminal. Then run the server.js file with node.

## Visuals
